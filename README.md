**Problem**: Every year Vendor Managers (VMs) negotiate with vendors to agree upon a price for which to source products. The procedure till now was to ask for price reductions based on anecdotes and VMs experience. I highlighted that as pain point for a data driven company and created a solution.

**Solution**: I created a dashboard which collects the trend of the main cost drivers e.g., raw materials, shipping, energy (App. 1), and of the main indexes which can be associated to a group of products (App. 2).

**Data**: Data are retrieved monthly from the [S&P Connect portal](https://connect.ihsmarkit.com/login?callingUrl=https%3a%2f%2fconnect.ihsmarkit.com%2fhome).

**Main features**:
  1. QoQ and YoY comparison.
  2. Quick search based on clusters or specific product name.
  3. Geographic filter.
  4. Both historical trend (for high selection of indexes) and forecast (VMs negotiate for the future price).
  5. Top & Bottom performer section connected with a monthly newsletter flash to spot for VMs if their products price are drastically increasing or decreasing (App. 3).
